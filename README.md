### Introduction
This repo will be a collection of commonly used C++ libs.

### Coding Style
Source files in this repo are added from different repos and they are NOT YET unified
in term of my coding style, will do.

My ultimate coding style and convention for open-source libs repository should look
like in [simple lru](./lru/simple-lru/lru.hh) and [filesystem](./filesystem).
