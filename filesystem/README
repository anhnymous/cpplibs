C++17 officially provided std::filesystem. But ...

But, sometimes, I want to use filesystem for SW development on HW platforms that
shipped with non-up-to-date toolchains. And those toolchains could not compile source
code which employs modern C++ features and syntaxs, i.e. std::filesystem, std::optional.

So, sometimes, I have to rollout a trivial implementation of such things, like
anhthd::cpplibs::filesystem which mimics std::filesystem interfaces.
