1. Hash algorithm
The current implementation is using a hashing algorithms which is not really good.
It is causing hash collision.

2. The current implementation does not allow user "plug" their hash function into
the LRU data structure. I should allow users specify their desired hashing function.

3. The current implementation is only applicable for key-value pairs of string and
string. I may need to make the implementation more open.
